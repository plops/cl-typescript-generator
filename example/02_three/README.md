```
i want to write a typescript program that uses three js to display a sphere. explain the modern procedure of preparing the dependencies and how to host a test page locally. i have npm and tsc and edit in visual studio code. what else is required?
```

Absolutely! Here's the breakdown of creating a TypeScript project with Three.js, along with instructions for running the code locally.

**Project Setup**

1. **Project Initialization:**
   - Create a new folder for your project (e.g., `my-threejs-sphere`)
   - Open a terminal and navigate to this folder.
   - Run `npm init -y` to initialize an `package.json` file.

2. **Installing Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install Three.js:
     ```bash
     npm install three
     ```
   - Since you're using TypeScript, install the Three.js type definitions for type safety:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev @types/three
     ```

3. **TypeScript Configuration:**
   - Create a `tsconfig.json` file in your project root with the following basic configuration:
     ```json
     {
       "compilerOptions": {
         "target": "ES5",
         "module": "commonjs",
         "outDir": "./dist",
         "rootDir": "./src",
         "strict": true,
         "esModuleInterop": true 
       }
     }
     ```

**Creating your Sphere**

1. **Source Code (`src/index.ts`):**
   ```typescript
   import * as THREE from 'three';

   // Scene
   const scene = new THREE.Scene();

   // Camera 
   const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(75, window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight, 0.1, 1000);

   // Renderer
   const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
   renderer.setSize(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
   document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement);

   // Sphere 
   const geometry = new THREE.SphereGeometry(1, 32, 32);
   const material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 }); 
   const sphere = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
   scene.add(sphere);

   // Position the camera
   camera.position.z = 5;

   // Animation loop
   function animate() {
       requestAnimationFrame(animate);

       sphere.rotation.x += 0.01;
       sphere.rotation.y += 0.01;

       renderer.render(scene, camera);
   }
   animate();
   ```

2. **HTML File (`index.html`):**
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Three.js Sphere</title>
       <style>
           body { margin: 0; }
       </style>
   </head>
   <body>
       <script src="dist/index.js"></script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

**Local Development Server**

You'll need a simple server to view your project. Consider these options:

* **Live Server (VS Code Extension):** This VS Code extension provides a simple development server.  Install it and then right-click your `index.html` file and choose "Open with Live Server."
* **Other tools:**  `http-server` (install with `npm install -g http-server`) or any lightweight server like Python's `http.server`.

**Compiling TypeScript:**

- Run `tsc` in your terminal to compile your TypeScript code into JavaScript (`dist/index.js`)

**Explanation**

* **Three.js Components:**  The code creates a scene (`THREE.Scene`), a camera (`THREE.PerspectiveCamera`),  a renderer (`THREE.WebGLRenderer`), a sphere geometry, and a material, then renders it.
* **Animation:** The `animate` function creates a simple animation loop where the sphere rotates.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on specific parts or want additional features in your Three.js scene! 


## How to Install webpack

```
show me how to use webpack to bundle my three js project

```

Absolutely! Let's outline the process of configuring Webpack to bundle your Three.js project.

**Assumptions**

* You have basic familiarity with Node.js and npm.
* You have an existing project structure with an entry point JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`) using Three.js

**Steps**

1. **Project Setup**
   *  Initialize npm: `npm init -y`
   *  Install Webpack and its command-line tool: `npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli`
   *  Install Three.js: `npm install three`

2. **Create `webpack.config.js`**
   Create a file named `webpack.config.js` at the root of your project. Here's a basic configuration:

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   module.exports = {
     mode: 'development', // Can be switched to 'production' later
     entry: './src/index.js', // Your Three.js JavaScript entry point
     output: {
       filename: 'bundle.js',
       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist') // Output directory
     },
     module: {
       rules: [
         {
           test: /\.(glsl|vs|fs|vert|frag)$/, // Handle shaders if you're using them
           use: ['raw-loader']
         }
       ]
     } 
   };
   ```

3. **Update `index.html`**
   Modify your `index.html` to load the bundled output script:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Three.js with Webpack</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <script src="dist/bundle.js"></script> 
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. **Run Webpack**
   Execute Webpack in your terminal: `npx webpack` (assumes you installed `webpack-cli`)

**Explanation**

* **`entry`:**  Tells Webpack where to start your project graph.
* **`output`:** Specifies the name (`bundle.js`) and location (`dist`) for the bundled file.
* **`mode`**: Sets Webpack to  development mode (unminified), but you can switch to 'production'  for a minified final build.
* **`module.rules`:**  Loaders configure Webpack to handle specific file types.  This example assumes you might have shader files with extensions like `.glsl`.

**Additional Tweaks**

* **Development Server:** Add the `webpack-dev-server` for a quick development setup with live reloading.
* **Loaders:** You might need additional loaders for different file types (images, models, etc.). 
* **Plugins** Webpack offers powerful plugins for optimization and code handling.


**Important:** Webpack configurations can range from simple to complex.  Adapt this setup based on your project's requirements. 

**Let me know if you have specific file types or features you want to include in your bundle. I'll provide tailored configuration updates!** 

### Note: Webpack and Typescript

Eventually I realized that webpack doesn't support typescript. It does however consume a .ts file as long as it is also valid javascript. once i added a function with type hints webpack emitted errors.

the fix is to call tsc and then webpack:

```
example/02_three $ tsc;npx webpack
asset bundle.js 661 KiB [compared for emit] [minimized] [big] (name: main) 1 related asset
./dist/index.js 2.05 KiB [built] [code generated]
./node_modules/three/build/three.cjs 1.23 MiB [built] [code generated]

WARNING in asset size limit: The following asset(s) exceed the recommended size limit (244 KiB).
This can impact web performance.
Assets: 
  bundle.js (661 KiB)

WARNING in entrypoint size limit: The following entrypoint(s) combined asset size exceeds the recommended limit (244 KiB). This can impact web performance.
Entrypoints:
  main (661 KiB)
      bundle.js


WARNING in webpack performance recommendations: 
You can limit the size of your bundles by using import() or require.ensure to lazy load some parts of your application.

```


## Setting up github action and hosting on github pages

```
create a github action for my project and i also want to have a site on github pages that shows a running version of my code:

example/02_three $ find .|grep -v node_mo
.
./.vscode
./.vscode/tasks.json
./webpack.config.js
./dist
./dist/index.js
./dist/bundle.js.LICENSE.txt
./dist/bundle.js
./index.html
./package.json
./README.md
./tsconfig.json
./src
./src/index.ts
./package-lock.json
```

Absolutely! Let's set up a GitHub Action to streamline your Three.js project deployment to GitHub Pages. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved:

**Assumptions**

* You already have your code ready in a GitHub repository.
* Your Three.js project builds into a folder like `dist` using tools like Webpack.

**Steps**

1. **Create a GitHub Action Workflow File**

   * Create a directory named `.github/workflows` at the root of your repository.
   * Inside that directory, create a YAML file, for example, name it `build-and-deploy.yml`. Here's the content for your workflow:

   ```yaml
   name: Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main ]  # Change the branch name if needed 

   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest

       steps:
         - name: Checkout code 🛎️
           uses: actions/checkout@v3

         - name: Install Dependencies 📦
           uses: actions/setup-node@v3
           with:
             node-version: '18' # Or suitable Node.js version
             cache: 'npm'
         - run: npm ci

         - name: Build your Project 🏗️  
           run: npm run build  # Assumes you have a 'build' script in package.json

         - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages 🚀
           uses: actions/deploy-to-github-pages@v1
           with:
             branch: gh-pages # Create this branch if it doesn't exist
             folder: dist  # Or a different folder containing your build output 
   ```

2. **Set Up an Access Token (If Needed)**

    The `actions/deploy-to-github-pages` action might require an access token for authentication in some setups:

    * Go to your GitHub settings -> "Developer Settings" -> "Personal access tokens."
    * Generate a new token with the "repo" scope.
    * Store this token as a secret in your GitHub repository. Go to your repository's settings -> "Secrets" -> "Actions"  -> "New repository secret". Name it something like `ACCESS_TOKEN`.

3. **Modify the Workflow (If Needed)**

   * **Branch Names:** Adjust the `on: push: branches: [ main ]`  section to suit your needs.
   * **Node.js Version:**  Tweak the `node-version` if you're using a different Node.js version.
   * **Build Command:**   Ensure the `npm run build` part aligns with your project's actual build script.

4. **Commit and Push**

   Commit your workflow file (along with other changes), and push it to your remote GitHub repository. This will trigger the Action.

5. **Configure GitHub Pages Source**

   * Go to your repository's Settings -> Pages.
   * Under "Source," select the `gh-pages` branch and then the root directory (`/`).

**How It Works**

* The Actions workflow triggers with each push to the specified branch.
* It checks out your code, installs dependencies, and runs your build command.
* The designated deployment action publishes your built content to the `gh-pages` branch.

**Let me know if you need help with tailoring the build command or any other parts of the workflow. Please provide details about how your project is set to be built!**
